# Ai - Machine Learning Project for the 1rst Elementary School of Corfu
**The project aims to teach the students to work with AI and Machine Learning while making them think how to make a public place better, with the use of technology.**
We will try to implement a software using pictoblox that will recognise if a public road is dangerous or not. We will approach it by identifying the key elements of what makes a road safe (crossroads, signs, etc..). We will train a model with these key elements and identify them on the pictoblox program using ai and ml. 

## The project is divided in to four phases and four teams

### 1. Requirements
The first team is writing down the requirements of the project while keeping also a calendar of what the class is doing for the project. Final target of this team is to produce an essay that will describe all the elements of the project

### 2. Presentation
The second team is responsible to make a summary of the essay of the first team and with the use of Powerpoint to create a presentation of the project.

### 3. AI & Machine Learning
The third team is responsible for creating the datasets, train the model using google teachable machines and produce a json file with the trained model. Trained model at https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/3cMMXHn2V/

### 4. Implementation
The fourth team is responsible to implement the project using the requirements of the first team and the trained model of the third team.
